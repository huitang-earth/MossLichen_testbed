# MossLichen_testbed

This repository is to keep all the data and related scripts (python) for moss and lichen model development and validation.  

The scripts will include retrieving moss and lichen data from original sources, organizing the data in a way that is readily usable for model development, and reading corresponding data for model parameterization or model validation.
